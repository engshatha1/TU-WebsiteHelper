						Types of pop-ups by format
						<ol>
							<li> Hello-boards </li> 
							<li> Page-stops </li>
						</ol>

						First of all, these two types differ in navigation, size, and the display’s timing, not in design or location. 
						<br> 
						The pop-ups of these types are displayed immediately or a few seconds after a user visits a website. In some cases, they can even appear before the content of a page fully loads. 
						<br><br> 
						Hello-boards are now used more often than page stops. Modern hello-boards are smaller than predecessors, don’t overlay the content of a page and let users decide whether to close a website or continue browsing. 
						<br><br> 
						Whereas page-stops mostly attract attention to the content of a window, overlap the page and sometimes are displayed without navigation preventing users from browsing until a target action is completed.

						Types of pop-ups by action
						<ol style = "color: #EBC959">
							<li> Entry pop-ups </li>
								This type pop ups before a page fully loads or almost right after its content is displayed.
								<br><br>
								
							<li> Click pop-ups </li>
								This type is activated when a user clicks a certain link, image, or word. Click pop-ups depend on action and are the least annoying to users. They appear when users want to see them and work gently without any risk to website conversion.
								<br><br>
								
							<li> Sidebar scroll pop-ups </li>
								This type of pop-up looks the most natural, thanks to its suitable location and timing. They are displayed when users already have a good grasp of content and probably won’t stop browsing the website because of a pop-up. 
								<br><br>
								
							<li> Timed pop-ups </li>
								They aren’t so annoying as entry pop-ups. Additionally, they aren’t shown to every user but only to those interested in the corresponding offer.
								<br><br>
								
							<li> Exit pop-ups </li>
								The task is to make an attractive offer before a user leaves a website. To do that, website owners often use different bonuses and promise discounts. Such pop-ups are also shown at the cart stage to motivate users to place an order.

						Types of pop-ups by placement

							<li> Header pop-ups </li>
								appear at the top of the screen. They can be dynamic and follow the content of a page or static.
								<br><br>
								
							<li> Center pop-ups </li>
								The center of the screen is the most common place to display pop-ups. Here they are much more likely to be noticed.
								<br><br>
								
							<li> Sidebar pop-ups </li>
								They appear when a user scrolls the corresponding page and look like a small humble window on its left or right side. Scroll pop-ups appear when a user already had enough time to check out most of the page. Therefore, they are relevant to the user path.
								<br><br>
								
							<li> Footer pop-ups </li>
								They are  pinned at the bottom of a website.
